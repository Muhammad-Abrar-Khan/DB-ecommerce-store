# E-commerce Website

This is a group project for my university course "DBMS". Me and my group partner Zain Ul Rab made it out by collaboration.
The **E-commerce Website** project provides a hands-on experience in building an e-commerce platform focused on mobile devices. It covers the process of creating an HTML template, transforming it into PHP to enhance functionality, and using a MySQL database to efficiently manage and display products. This project is ideal for learning the fundamentals of web development and database integration within an e-commerce context.
